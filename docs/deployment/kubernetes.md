# Deployment guide for Kubernetes

This guide is for deployment to a vanilla Kubernetes 1.8 or 1.9 cluster running on Linux hosts. It is not a hand-book, please see the set of guides and blogs posts available at [openfaas/guide](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/guide).

## Kubernetes

OpenFaaS is Kubernetes-native and uses *Deployments*, *Services* and *Secrets*. For more detail check out the ["faas-netes" repository](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes).

### Build a cluster

You can start evaluating FaaS and building functions on your laptop or on a VM (cloud or on-prem).

* [10 minute guides for minikube / kubeadm](https://blog.alexellis.io/tag/learn-k8s/)

Additional information on [setting up Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/).

We have a special guide for minikube here:

* [Getting started with OpenFaaS on minikube](https://medium.com/devopslinks/getting-started-with-openfaas-on-minikube-634502c7acdf)

!!! tip
    Are you using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)? You'll need to create an RBAC role with the following command:

    ```bash
    $ kubectl create clusterrolebinding "cluster-admin-$(whoami)" \
      --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
      --user="$(gcloud config get-value core/account)"
    ```

### Pick helm or YAML files for deployment

If you'd like to use helm follow the instructions in 2.0a and then come back here, otherwise follow 2.0b to use plain `kubectl`.

### Deploy with Helm

A Helm chart is provided in the `faas-netes` repository. Follow the link below then come back to this guide.

* [OpenFaaS Helm chart](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes/blob/master/HELM.md)

To enable SSL while using Helm, try one of the following references:

- [Using nginx-ingress and cert-manager](/reference/ssl/kubernetes-with-cert-manager.md)

### Deploy OpenFaaS

This step assumes you are running `kubectl` on a master host.

* Clone the code

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas-netes
    ```

    Deploy a stack with asynchronous functionality provided by NATS Streaming.

* Deploy the whole stack

    This command is split into two parts so that the OpenFaaS namespaces are always created first:

    * openfaas - for OpenFaaS services
    * openfaas-fn - for functions

    ```bash
    $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfaas/faas-netes/master/namespaces.yml
    ```

    Now deploy OpenFaaS:

    ```bash
    $ cd faas-netes && \
    kubectl apply -f ./yaml
    ```

    !!! note
        For deploying on a cloud that supports Kubernetes *LoadBalancers* you may also want to apply the configuration in: `cloud/lb.yml`.

### Use OpenFaaS

After deploying OpenFaaS you can start using one of the guides or blog posts to create Serverless functions or test [community functions](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md).

![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/72f71cb0b0f6cae1c84f5a40ad57b7a9e389d0b7/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f44466b5575483158734141744e4a362e6a70673a6d656469756d)

You can also watch a complete walk-through of OpenFaaS on Kubernetes which demonstrates auto-scaling in action and how to use the Prometheus UI. [Video walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DbrLsUvaso).

## Deploy a function

For simplicity the default configuration uses NodePorts rather than an IngressController (which is more complicated to setup).

| Service           | TCP port |
--------------------|----------|
| API Gateway / UI  | 31112    |
| Prometheus        | 31119    |

!!! note
    If you're an advanced Kubernetes user, you can add an IngressController to your stack and remove the NodePort assignments.

* Deploy a sample function

There are currently no sample functions built into this stack, but we can deploy them quickly via the UI or FaaS-CLI.

### Use the CLI

* Install the CLI

    ```bash
    $ curl -sL https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
    ```

    If you like you can also run the script via a non-root user. Then the faas-cli binary is downloaded to the current working directory instead.

* Then clone some samples to deploy on your cluster.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli
    ```

    Edit stack.yml and change your gateway URL from `localhost:8080` to `kubernetes-node-ip:31112` or pass the `--gateway` / `-g` flag to commands.

    i.e.

    ```bash
    provider:
      name: faas
      gateway: http://192.168.4.95:31112
    ```

    Now deploy the samples:

    ```bash
    $ faas-cli deploy -f stack.yml
    ```

    !!! info
        The `faas-cli` also supports an override of `--gateway http://...` for example:

        ```bash
        faas-cli deploy -f stack.yml --gateway http://127.0.0.1:31112
        ```

#### List the functions

```bash
$ faas-cli list -f stack.yml

or

$ faas-cli list  -g http://127.0.0.1:31112
Function                      Invocations    Replicas
inception                     0              1
nodejs-echo                   0              1
ruby-echo                     0              1
shrink-image                  0              1
stronghash                    2              1
```

Invoke a function:

```bash
$ echo -n "Test" | faas-cli invoke stronghash -g http://127.0.0.1:31112
c6ee9e33cf5c6715a1d148fd73f7318884b41adcb916021e2bc0e800a5c5dd97f5142178f6ae88c8fdd98e1afb0ce4c8d2c54b5f37b30b7da1997bb33b0b8a31  -
```

* Build your first Python function

[Your first serverless Python function with OpenFaaS](https://blog.alexellis.io/first-faas-python-function/)

### Use the UI

The UI is exposed on NodePort 31112.

Click "New Function" and fill it out with the following:

| Field      | Value                        |
-------------|------------------------------|
| Service    | nodeinfo                     |
| Image      | functions/nodeinfo:latest    |
| fProcess   | node main.js                 |
| Network    | default                      |

* Test the function

Your function will appear after a few seconds and you can click "Invoke"

The function can also be invoked through the CLI:

```bash
$ echo -n "" | faas-cli invoke --gateway http://kubernetes-ip:31112 nodeinfo
$ echo -n "verbose" | faas-cli invoke --gateway http://kubernetes-ip:31112 nodeinfo
```

## Customizing the install
### Use a private registry with Kubernetes

If you are using a hosted private Docker registry ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or other),
in order to check how to configure it, please visit the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry).

####  Deploy a function from a private Docker image

With the following commands you can deploy a function from a private Docker image, tag and push it to your docker registry account:

```bash
$ docker pull functions/alpine:latest
$ docker tag functions/alpine:latest $DOCKER_USERNAME/private-alpine:latest
$ docker push $DOCKER_USERNAME/private-alpine:latest
```

Log into the [Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and make your image `private-alpine` private.

Then create your openfaas project:

```bash
$ mkdir privatefuncs && cd privatefuncs
$ touch stack.yaml
```

In your favorite editor, open stack.yaml and add

```yml
provider:
  name: faas
  gateway: http://localhost:8080

functions:
  protectedapi:
    lang: Dockerfile
    skip_build: true
    image: username/private-alpine:latest
```

#### Create an image pull secret

If you try to deploy using `faas-cli deploy` it will fail because Kubernetes can not pull the image. You can verify this in the Kubernetes dashboard or via the CLI using the `kubectl describe` command.

To deploy the function, you need to create an [Image Pull Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

You should set the following environmental variables:

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=<your_docker_username>
export DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your_docker_password>
export DOCKER_EMAIL=<your_docker_email>
```

Then run this command to create the secret:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub \
    --docker-username=$DOCKER_USERNAME \
    --docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD \
    --docker-email=$DOCKER_EMAIL
```

Then you need to add the secret to your `stack.yml` file:

```yml
secrets:
      - dockerhub
```

This is a `stack.yml` example with the secret added in it:

```yml
 provider:
   name: faas
   gateway: http://localhost:8080

 functions:
   protectedapi:
     lang: Dockerfile
     skip_build: true
     image: username/private-alpine:latest
     secrets:
      - dockerhub
```

You can deploy your function using `faas-cli deploy`. If you inspect the Kubernetes pods, you will see that it can pull the docker image.

#### Link the image pull secret to a namespace service account

Instead of always editing the function .yml you can link your private Docker repository secret to the Kubernetes namespace service account manifest. This will auto add the `imagePullSecret` property to any deployment/pod manifest refrencing an image in that particular private repo.

Create the image pull secret in the `openfaas-fn` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry myPrivateRepo \
    --docker-username=$DOCKER_USERNAME \
    --docker-password=$DOCKER_PASSWORD \
    --docker-email=$DOCKER_EMAIL \
    --namespace openfaas-fn
```

Open up the service account manifest for editing:

`kubectl edit serviceaccount default -n openfaas-fn`

At the bottom of the manifest add:

``` yaml
imagePullSecrets:
- name: myPrivateRepo
```

Save your changes.
OpenFaaS will now deploy functions with images in private repositories without having to specify the secret in the deployment manifests.

### Setting the ImagePullPolicy with OpenFaaS

Kubernetes allows you to control the conditions for when Docker images are pulled onto a node via the [imagePullPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images) config. Your options are

- `Always` : Kuberenetes will pull the Docker image from the registry every time
- `IfNotPresent` : Kuberentes will only pull the image if it does not exist in the local registry cache
- `Never` : Kuberenetes will never try to pull the image, you must manually ensure that the image already exists in the local cache

By default, deployed functions will use an `imagePullPolicy` of `Always`, which ensures functions using static image tags (e.g. "latest" tags) are refreshed during an update. This behavior is configurable in `faas-netes` via the `image_pull_policy` environment variable. When installing via helm you can easily set this value during install using

```
helm upgrade openfaas openfaas/openfaas --install --set "faasnetesd.imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent"
```

If installing via a custom yaml manifest, ensure that your `faas-netes` contain spec includes

```
env:
  - name: image_pull_policy
    value: "IfNotPresent"
```

[See here](/deployment/kubernetes/) for more details on deploying OpenFaaS in Kubernetes.

#### Which imagePullPolicy should you use

As mentioned above, the default value is `Always`. Every time a function is deployed or is scaled up, Kubernetes will pull a potentially updated copy of the image from the registry. If you are using static image tags like `latest`, this is necessary.

When set to `IfNotPresent`, function deployments may not be updated when using static image tags like `latest`. `IfNotPresent` is particularly useful when developing locally with minikube. In this case, you can set your local environment to use [minikube's docker](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/reusing_the_docker_daemon.md) so `faas-cli build` builds directly into minikube's image store. `faas-cli push` is unnecessary in this workflow - use faas-cli build then faas-cli deploy.

When set to `Never`, only local (or pulled) images will work. This is useful if you want to tightly control which images are available and run in your Kubernetes cluster.
